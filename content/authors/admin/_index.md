I am an undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering(SSE), Tongji University. I'm not a typical software engineering student who specializes in developing software. Instead, I have pursued a major in AI and have completed several projects focused on the application of AI during my undergraduate studies, including areas such as NLP, time series analysis, and reinforcement learning. You can find more information about these projects in the Projects section.
