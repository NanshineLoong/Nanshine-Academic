I am an undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering(SSE), Tongji University. I am not a classic software engineering student that major in producing a software. Actually, I am more like a student majoring in AI. I have tried some projects which focusing on AI's application  during my undergraduate student time, including NLP, Time Series, Reinforcement Learing. You can see more details in the projects part.
